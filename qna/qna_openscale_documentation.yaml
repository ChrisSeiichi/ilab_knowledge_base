  - question: What is feedback data and how can I provide it in OpenScale?
    answer: |
      The feedback data is like providing an answer sheet with actual observed outcomes.
      The monitor can run the model as if the answers are not known, then compare the predicted outcomes to the actual
      outcomes and provide accuracy scores based on quality metrics.To provide the feedback data you will use to
      evaluate the model click the Endpoints page and do one of the following:
      Click Upload feedback data and upload a file with labeled data.
      Click the Endpoints tab and specify an endpoint that connects to the feedback data source.
  - question: What fairness metrics does OpenSclae support?
    answer: |
      Disparate impact, Statistical parity difference, False negative rate difference, False positive rate difference,
      False discovery rate difference, 
      False omission rate difference, Error rate difference, Average odds difference, Average absolute odds difference
  - question: How can I view local explanations in OpenScale?
    answer: |
      Watson OpenScale provides different methods that you can use to view local explanations.
      When you review evaluation results, you can select the Number of explanations link to open the Select an
      explanation window.
      Select an explanation window displays
      In the Action column select Explain to display the Transaction details page. The Transactions details provides
      different explanations, depending on which explanation methods and model types that you use.
      For categorical models, on the Explain tab, the Transaction details page provides an analysis of the features
      that influenced the outcome of the transaction with the local explanation method that you use. For SHAP, you can
      select the background data that you use in the Background data menu to regenerate the explanation.
      Transaction details
      On the Inspect tab, Watson OpenScale generates advanced contrastive explanations for binary classification
      models that you can use to experiment with features by changing the values to see whether the outcome changes.
      Transaction details on the inspect tab show values that might produce a different outcome
      You can also view different explanations for the following type of transactions:
      Explaining image transactions
      Explaining unstructured text transactions
      Explaining tabular transactions
  - question: When reviewing evaluations for explainability, which details can we view in OpenScale?
    answer: |
      When you review evaluation results for explainability, you can view the following details:

      Feature influence : The most important features in descending order of the average absolute SHAP values
      Distribution : The SHAP values for distribution of each feature
      Comparison : The change in features influence between current global and baseline global explanation.
  - question: What types of evaluations can I configure in OpenScal?
    answer: |
      If you're using the Watson OpenScale service, you can configure the following types of evaluations:

      Quality
      Evaluates how well your model predicts correct outcomes that match labeled test data.
      Fairness
      Evaluates whether your model produces biased outcomes that provide favorable results for one group over another.
      Drift
      Evaluates how your model changes in accuracy and data consistency by comparing recent transactions to your
      training data.
      Drift v2
      Evaluates changes in your model output, the accuracy of your predictions, and the distribution of your 
      input data.
      Model health
      Evaluates how efficiently your model deployment processes your transactions.
      You can also create custom evaluations and metrics to generate a greater variety of insights about your model
      performance.
