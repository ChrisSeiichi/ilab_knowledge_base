predictions into four quadrants that represent the measurement of actual and predicted values as shown in the following example: The true negative (TN) quadrant represents values that are actually negative and predicted as negative and the true positive (TP) quadrant represents values that are actually positive and predicted as positive. The false positive (FP) quadrant represents values that are actually negative but are predicted as positive and the the false negative (FN) quadrant represents values that are actually positive but predicted as negative. Note: Performance measures are not supported for regression models. **Parent topic:** [Configuring fairness evaluations](/docs/en/SSQNUZ_5.0.x/wsj/model/wos-monitor-fairness.html)
