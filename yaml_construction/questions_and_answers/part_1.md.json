{"questions_and_answers": [{"question": "What are the different ways to configure fairness evaluations for traditional machine learning models?", "answer": "Fairness evaluations can be configured manually or by running a custom notebook to generate a configuration file, which can then be uploaded to specify the settings for the evaluation."}, {"question": "How do you configure fairness evaluations for traditional machine learning models?", "answer": "You can configure fairness evaluations manually or by running a custom notebook to generate a configuration file. You can upload the configuration file to specify the settings for your evaluation. You can also specify the reference group, model attributes, minimum and maximum sample size for evaluations, and set a fairness threshold."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of configuring fairness evaluations in machine learning models?", "answer": "To determine whether the model produces biased outcomes and identify when the model shows a tendency to provide favorable outcomes more often for one group over another."}]}
