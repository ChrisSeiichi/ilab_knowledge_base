{"questions_and_answers": [{"question": "What is the purpose of setting a minimum and maximum sample size for each metric in fairness evaluations?", "answer": "The purpose of setting a minimum and maximum sample size for each metric in fairness evaluations is to indicate the minimum or maximum number of model transactions that you want to evaluate."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of setting fairness thresholds in Watsonx.governance?", "answer": "To configure fairness evaluations with custom settings, including minimum and maximum sample sizes for each metric, and to set threshold values for each metric to create alerts on the evaluation summary page when metric scores violate these thresholds."}, {"question": "What is indirect bias in the context of fairness evaluations, and how is it identified?", "answer": "Indirect bias occurs when a field not used in model training is associated with values in the training features, implying certain characteristics. For example, the profession 'student' may imply a younger individual, even if the Age field was excluded from model training. Indirect bias is identified by finding associated values in the training features."}]}
