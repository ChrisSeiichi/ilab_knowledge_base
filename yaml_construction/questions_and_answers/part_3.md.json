{"questions_and_answers": [{"question": "What is disparate impact and how is it calculated?", "answer": "Disparate impact is a fairness metric that compares the percentage of favorable outcomes for a monitored group to the percentage of favorable outcomes for a reference group. It is calculated using the formula: (num_positives(privileged=False) / num_instances(privileged=False)) / (num_positives(privileged=True) / num_instances(privileged=True))."}, {"question": "What is disparate impact in the context of fairness evaluations?", "answer": "Disparate impact is a fairness metric that compares the percentage of favorable outcomes for a monitored group to the percentage of favorable outcomes for a reference group.
