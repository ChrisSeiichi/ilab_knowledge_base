{"questions_and_answers": [{"question": "What are the different types of explanations that Watson OpenScale supports for analyzing transactions?", "answer": "Watson OpenScale supports Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), contrastive explanations, and Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) to analyze transactions."}, {"question": "What is the difference between LIME, contrastive explanations, and SHAP in Watson OpenScale?", "answer": "LIME identifies the most important features for a specific data point by analyzing nearby data points. Contrastive explanations calculate the changes needed to change the prediction or maintain the same prediction. SHAP is a game-theoretic approach that explains the output of machine learning models by assigning each feature an importance value."}, {"question": "What are the three explanation methods that Watson OpenScale uses to analyze transactions?", "answer": "Watson OpenScale uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), contrastive explanations, and Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) to analyze transactions."}]}
